Description:

"... you will need to read in two text files â€“ one of pirates a\
nd one about types of pirate ships. The Game class will manage \
the two arrays of pirates and ships. Both lists can be assumed \
to be static and you have been given two constants to count thr\
ough the files as needed.                                       
                                                                
The player (or user) starts with a pirate and a type of ship. T\
hen they can search for treasure. When they encounter an enemy,\
 if they think they can beat the enemy, they can choose to batt\
le with the enemy pirate or try to flee. If they have a faster \
ship, they will be able to sneak away but if they are too slow,\
 the enemy ship will attack them.
