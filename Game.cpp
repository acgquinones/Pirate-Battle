Description:  

"... you will need to read in two text files â€“ one of pirates and one about types of pirate ships. The Game class will manage the two arrays of pirates and ships. Both lists can be assumed to be static and you have been given two constants to count through the files as needed.

The player (or user) starts with a pirate and a type of ship. Then they can search for treasure. When they encounter an enemy, if they think they can beat the enemy, they can choose to battle with the enemy pirate or try to flee. If they have a faster ship, they will be able to sneak away but if they are too slow, the enemy ship will attack them.
